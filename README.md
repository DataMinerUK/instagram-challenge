Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!

## v1.0

* All images can be viewed and each image can be viewed on its own page
* Users can post images, like images and comment on images
* An individual image page will show its likes and comments
* TODO username, descriptions and comments cannot be empty

## v2.0

* Users images can be viewed on a users page
* Users can delete images from their user page
* Comments can be edited by their creators
* Images have tags
* Tags have a page where you can view all the images they are associated with

## v3.0

* Add styling
* Use Bootstrap
